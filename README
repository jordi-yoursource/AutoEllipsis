Notes

See index.html for usage examples and sample source code

This script does not add ellipsis dynamically, that is, once the script has run, any change in width of html elements will not adjust positioning of the ellipsis. You could call the script on a resize event however if the width is increasing in size there is no way (currently) for the script to be able to expand the text.

This script does not yet support multiple lines - this is the feature I most want to implement and will probably be in the next version.
